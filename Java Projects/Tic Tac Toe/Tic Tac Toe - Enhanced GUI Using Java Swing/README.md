## 🏗️ How It Works
1. Each player clicks on an empty cell to place their symbol (X or O).  
2. After every move, the program checks for a **winner** or **draw**.  
3. If a player wins, all buttons are disabled and a message is displayed.  
4. The **Reset** button clears the board for a new game.  
5. The **End** button closes the application.
