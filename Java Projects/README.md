# Java Projects

This repository contains multiple Java projects that I have developed to practice and demonstrate my Java programming skills. Each project is organized in its own folder with relevant source files and functionality.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sriabirami-S/My Projects.git
```
2. Open the desired project folder in Eclipse or any Java IDE.

3. Run the main Java file as a Java Application.

- LMS: LibraryGUI.java

- Flight Booking System: flight_booking_system.java

- Tic-Tac-Toe: TicTacToe.java

4. Follow the console or GUI prompts as required by each project.

## Future Enhancements

- LMS: Connect to a remote database, improve UI design, add user authentication.

- Flight Booking System: Add GUI interface, database storage, email notifications.

- Tic-Tac-Toe: Add AI player mode and GUI using Swing or JavaFX.
